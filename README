# De-Ethics MVP: Space AI Ethics and Compliance Platform with Quantum Integration

## 1. Vision, Scope, and Quantum Mission
De-Ethics establishes a quantum-aware, interplanetary ethics governance codex for autonomous and semi-autonomous agents. The
platform ensures:

- **Quantum-anchored trust**: Every qubit exchange—between orbital platforms, deep-space probes, and Earth-based governance
  hubs—maintains verifiable alignment with De-Omega-Point human-value principles.
- **Pan-solar compliance**: Policies span multi-jurisdictional treaties, planetary protection mandates, and mission-specific
  safety requirements.
- **Secure interplanetary coordination**: Quantum relays, quantum repeaters, and post-quantum fallbacks are orchestrated to
  deliver resilient, ethics-first communication across light-minute delays.

## 2. Foundational Ethical Pillars for Quantum Operations
1. **Transparency by Design**
   - Quantum-derived insights must ship with explainability payloads (model provenance, entanglement partners, decision
     rationales).
   - Human-in-the-loop checkpoints are required before mission-critical execution.
2. **Accountability Across Relays**
   - Each quantum instruction links to authenticated mission plans, ethical approvals, and agent identities stamped onto an
     immutable interplanetary ledger.
   - Tamper-evident signatures enforce traceability even when routing across federated quantum networks.
3. **Quantum Resource Stewardship**
   - Allocate scarce qubit capacity according to ethical priority queues (crew safety > planetary protection > scientific
     experimentation > commercial payloads).
   - Automated stewardship agents audit for inequitable usage spikes or unauthorized entanglement channels.
4. **Rights Preservation & Cultural Respect**
   - Guard privacy and cultural sovereignty of extraterrestrial settlements by applying differential privacy to quantum sensing
     feeds and honoring local governance protocols for data-sharing and AI oversight.

## 3. Quantum Communication & Encryption Safeguards
- **Layered Encryption**: Pair QKD with post-quantum classical algorithms (e.g., CRYSTALS-Kyber) to enable authenticated
  fallbacks when entanglement fidelity drops below 0.92.
- **Ethical Key Lifecycle**: Quantum keys carry ethical metadata (mission intent, risk tier) and auto-expire after a single
  high-risk transmission or 12 hours, whichever is sooner.
- **Interference Handling**: When solar storms or decoherence events threaten channel integrity, agents must downshift to
  degraded yet auditable communication profiles and notify governance nodes within 90 seconds.

## 4. Decision Trees for Quantum-Enabled Agents
### 4.1 Quantum Channel Integrity Assessment
```
if QBER > threshold or entanglement_fidelity < target:
    switch_to_post_quantum_fallback()
    trigger_alert(level="critical", recipients=[mission_control, ethics_officer])
    run_diagnostics(scope=[relay, repeater_chain, local_qubits])
    await human_clearance()
else:
    continue_quantum_operations()
```
- Threshold defaults: QBER ≤ 0.03, fidelity ≥ 0.94.
- Diagnostics log root-cause hypotheses (environmental, adversarial, hardware fault) for later ethical audit.

### 4.2 Ethical Compliance Verification Workflow
```
for command in quantum_payload:
    decision_record = formal_verify(command, policies=current_ethics_stack)
    if not decision_record.compliant:
        hold_state("quarantine", command)
        notify(ethics_board, evidence=decision_record.proof)
        await human_resolution()
    else:
        append_to_audit_trail(command, decision_record)
        execute_with_confirmation(command)
```
- Formal verification modules must cite relevant policy clauses and timestamp the proof artifact.

### 4.3 Anomaly Response Protocol
```
if detect(decoherence_drift or adversarial_signature):
    cross_validate(using="redundant_relays")
    if disagreement_persists:
        enter_fail_safe(mode="crew_and_environment_priority")
        deploy joint_investigation(team=[mission_ops, ethics_board, quantum_security])
```
- Fail-safe maintains life-support, collision avoidance, and habitat safeguards while suspending discretionary tasks.

## 5. Visualization & Quantum Compliance Monitoring
- **Unified Telemetry Canvas**: Dashboards plot entanglement fidelity, latency variance, ethical compliance scores, and
  outstanding human-approval gates. Each widget exposes drill-downs to raw logs and explanatory summaries.
- **Real-Time Quantum Ethics Alerts**: Ethics deviations trigger synchronized notifications to Earth, lunar, and Martian
  councils with contextual narratives (root cause, impacted agents, recommended mitigations).
- **Ethics Heatmaps**: Visual overlays highlight regions of persistent anomalies or policy exemptions, enabling proactive
  governance intervention.
- **API Governance**: Quantum telemetry APIs enforce rate limiting, signed requests, and ethics scopes that restrict access to
  authorized auditors and regulators.

## 6. Operational Roles & Responsibilities
- **Mission Ethics Officers**: Approve policy updates, adjudicate holds, and liaise with human crews during incident response.
- **Quantum Network Custodians**: Maintain relays, repeater chains, and ensure physical-layer tamper protections (quantum seals,
  intrusion sensors).
- **AI Agent Maintainers**: Ship firmware updates, validate explainability modules, and run simulated drills for emergent
  quantum risks.
- **De-Omega-Point Governance Council**: Curate value-alignment directives and arbitrate cross-jurisdictional conflicts.

## 7. Iterative Quantum Updates & Governance Lifecycle
1. **Telemetry-Driven Reviews**
   - Quarterly ethics retrospectives ingest anomaly logs, near-miss reports, and human feedback to recalibrate policies.
2. **Quantum Innovation Watchlist**
   - Track advances in quantum repeaters, photonic processors, and error-corrected qubit architectures; update safeguards to
     integrate new capabilities responsibly.
3. **Scenario Simulation Sprints**
   - Bi-monthly simulation drills stress-test agents against edge-case quantum failures (e.g., entanglement hijacking,
     relativistic delays) and record remediation playbooks.
4. **Federated Policy Synchronization**
   - Distribute signed policy bundles via authenticated quantum channels; verify receipt and checksum attestation from every
     planetary node within 48 hours.
5. **Living Codex Publication**
   - Publish versioned releases with change logs, citing new ethical standards, retired practices, and outstanding research
     actions.

## 8. Future Expansion Roadmap
- **Quantum-Resilient Value Alignment Models**: Develop hybrid classical-quantum interpretable models to mediate value
  conflicts in real time.
- **Interplanetary Legal Harmonization**: Collaborate with emerging Martian and lunar legal frameworks to codify quantum
  communication norms into binding statutes.
- **Sentinel AI Guilds**: Foster cross-mission AI guilds that exchange best practices, adversarial threat intel, and ethics
  upgrades via secure quantum forums.

The De-Ethics codex remains a living artifact, continuously refining ethical assurances for quantum-enabled agents navigating the
expanding human presence throughout the solar system.
